# Project: Calendar Assistant and Math Teacher GPTs with Actions via Zapier

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the full implementation of integrating OpenAI's GPT with external services via the Zapier platform. Developed as part of a portfolio, the project includes two intelligent assistants configured to perform specific tasks:

1. **Calendar Assistant**: A smart assistant that can manage events in Google Calendar, including creating, searching, and organizing events using natural language.
2. **Math Teacher**: An educational assistant that generates math problems for students, evaluates their answers, and saves the results to Google Sheets for further analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenAI GPT (ChatGPT)**: For processing natural language requests and performing tasks.
- **Zapier**: For automation and integration with external applications.
- **Google Calendar**: For event management.
- **Google Sheets**: For data storage and analysis.

## Key Implementation Aspects

### 1. Calendar Assistant
- **Capabilities**:
  - Creating detailed events in Google Calendar based on user requests.
  - Searching and displaying upcoming events.
  - Handling time zones and dynamically adding event descriptions.
- **Interaction Examples**:
  - Example Query: "Schedule a meeting titled \"AI Conference\" for March 15, 2025, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM."
  - Users receive instant feedback and confirmation about created events.

### 2. Math Teacher
- **Capabilities**:
  - Generating personalized math problems for elementary school students.
  - Automatic evaluation of student answers.
  - Recording student name, assignment, answer, and grade in Google Sheets.
- **Interaction Examples**:
  - Example Query: "Give me a math problem."
  - The assistant interacts step-by-step, ensuring a logical and clear interaction.

## Key Features
- **Seamless Integration**:
  - Using the Zapier Actions feature to connect GPT with Google services.
  - No programming required for deployment.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Built-in instructions for troubleshooting issues, such as time zone errors or incomplete data.
- **Scalability**:
  - Possibility of adding new integrations, such as Slack, Telegram, or project management tools.

## Challenges Overcome
- **Time Zone Management**:
  - Developed a structured approach to clarify and manage event scheduling across different time zones.
- **Dynamic Data Storage**:
  - Implemented reliable integration with Google Sheets for seamless data recording and storage.
